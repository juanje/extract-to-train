# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data. Examples include:

- **Classification**: Predicting categories (e.g., spam detection)
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices)

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples:

- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- **Association**: Finding relationships between variables

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves agents learning through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step that involves:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting inaccurate data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data
3. **Normalization**: Scaling data to a common range
4. **Handling Missing Values**: Dealing with incomplete data

## Model Evaluation

Common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Conclusion

Machine learning continues to evolve and find applications across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. Understanding these fundamentals provides a solid foundation for exploring more advanced topics.
