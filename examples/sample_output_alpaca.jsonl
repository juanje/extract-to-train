{"instruction": "What is machine learning according to the document?", "input": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.", "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."}
{"instruction": "How does supervised learning differ from unsupervised learning?", "input": "Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. The algorithm learns from example input-output pairs. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. It discovers structure in data where you don't know what the output should look like.", "output": "Supervised learning uses labeled training data with known input-output pairs to learn mappings, while unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Supervised learning knows the desired output, whereas unsupervised learning discovers unknown structures in the data."}
{"instruction": "What are the main components of a neural network?", "input": "A neural network consists of interconnected nodes called neurons organized in layers. The basic components include: input layer (receives data), hidden layers (process information), output layer (produces results), weights (connection strengths), biases (threshold adjustments), and activation functions (determine neuron output).", "output": "The main components of a neural network are: 1) Input layer that receives data, 2) Hidden layers that process information, 3) Output layer that produces results, 4) Weights that represent connection strengths between neurons, 5) Biases that adjust thresholds, and 6) Activation functions that determine neuron outputs."}
{"instruction": "Why is data preprocessing important in machine learning?", "input": "Data preprocessing is crucial because real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, or contains errors. Raw data may have missing values, outliers, different scales, or irrelevant features. Preprocessing steps include cleaning, normalization, feature selection, and transformation to prepare data for optimal model performance.", "output": "Data preprocessing is important because real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, or contains errors. It involves cleaning data, handling missing values and outliers, normalizing different scales, and selecting relevant features. Proper preprocessing ensures optimal model performance by providing clean, consistent input data."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of cross-validation in model evaluation?", "input": "Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a machine learning model will perform on unseen data. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds, training on some folds and testing on others, then averaging the results. This provides a more robust estimate of model performance than a single train-test split.", "output": "Cross-validation assesses how well a machine learning model will perform on unseen data by splitting the dataset into multiple folds. The model trains on some folds and tests on others, with results averaged across all splits. This provides a more robust and reliable estimate of model performance than using a single train-test split."}
