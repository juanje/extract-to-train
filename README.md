2. **Ollama** installed and running locally
3. **Required models** downloaded:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1:8B
   ollama pull deepseek-r1:8B
   ```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/juanje/extract-to-train.git
cd extract-to-train

# Install with uv
uv sync

# Verify installation
extract-to-train setup
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Basic extraction with educational output
extract-to-train extract document.pdf --verbose

# Extract from Markdown documentation
extract-to-train extract technical_guide.md --verbose

# Generate Alpaca format for Axolotl/Unsloth
extract-to-train extract document.pdf --format alpaca --max-pairs 100

# Test with limited chunks from large document
extract-to-train extract large_document.pdf --max-chunks 10 --verbose

# Process with progressive saving and language specification
extract-to-train extract documento.pdf --language es --progress-file progress.jsonl

# Process Markdown with custom models
extract-to-train extract tutorial.md \
    --model-extract mistral:7B \

## 📚 Educational Features

### Transparent Processing
- **Step-by-step explanations** of each processing phase
- **Model configuration insights** with rationale for settings
- **Quality metrics** and performance statistics
- **Prompt engineering examples** with design explanations

### Learning-Focused Design
- **Verbose mode** (`--verbose`) shows detailed processing information
- **Explain mode** (`--explain`) provides educational context for decisions
- **Configuration explanations** help understand optimal settings
- **Quality analysis** teaches dataset evaluation principles

## 🚀 Large Document Processing

### Progressive Saving
For large documents, Extract-to-Train automatically saves Q&A pairs as they are generated and validated:

```bash
# Progress file is auto-generated by default
extract-to-train extract large_document.pdf --verbose

# Use custom progress file
extract-to-train extract document.pdf --progress-file my_progress.jsonl
```

**Progress file benefits:**
- ✅ **Recovery from interruptions**: No work lost if process stops
- 👀 **Real-time monitoring**: Review quality during processing  
- 🔄 **Incremental processing**: Resume from where you left off

### Chunk Limitation
Test processing on large documents by limiting chunks:

```bash
# Process only first 5 chunks for quality testing
extract-to-train extract large_manual.pdf --max-chunks 5 --verbose

# Combine with other limits for controlled testing
extract-to-train extract document.pdf --max-chunks 10 --max-pairs 20
```

**Use cases:**
- 📊 **Quality assessment**: Test generation quality before full processing
- ⚡ **Rapid prototyping**: Quick evaluation of document suitability
- 🧪 **Parameter tuning**: Test different model configurations efficiently

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Selection

The tool uses optimized model configurations based on extensive testing:

```yaml
