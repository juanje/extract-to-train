It works by calculating the gradient (partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to the model parameters, then updating the parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient. This iterative process continues until the algorithm converges to a minimum. The learning rate controls the step size of updates, and proper tuning is crucial for effective training."}]}

It works by applying the chain rule of calculus to propagate error signals backward through the network layers. Starting from the output layer, it calculates how much each weight contributed to the total error and adjusts them accordingly. Backpropagation is crucial because it makes training deep networks computationally feasible."}]}

They introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh. Without activation functions, neural networks would be limited to learning only linear relationships, regardless of depth."}]}

Mini-batch is most commonly used in practice."}]}
